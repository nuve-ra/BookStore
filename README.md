Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js: Download & Install Node.js (includes npm)

Git: Download & Install Git

Installation
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/nuve-ra/BookStore.git
cd BookStore

The project is likely structured with separate directories for the frontend and backend. Navigate into each and install their respective dependencies.

Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory:

cd backend

Install the Node.js dependencies:

npm install

Start the backend server:

npm start

The backend server should now be running, typically on http://localhost:5000 (or another port as configured in your Express app).

Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal window (keep the backend server running in the first terminal).

Navigate to the frontend (or client, react-app, etc.) directory. Assuming it's directly under BookStore:

cd ../frontend # Adjust this path if your frontend is in a different subfolder

(If your frontend is in the root of BookStore and the backend is in a backend subfolder, you might not need to cd into frontend.)

Install the frontend dependencies:

npm install

Start the React development server:

npm run dev

The frontend application should now be running, typically on http://localhost:5173 (Vite's default port) or another port.

Usage
Once both the backend and frontend servers are running:

Open your web browser and navigate to the frontend URL (e.g., http://localhost:5173).

You should see the BookStore application. Interact with the UI to view, add, edit, or delete books.

All data operations will be handled by the Express backend, which reads from and writes to your local JSON files.
